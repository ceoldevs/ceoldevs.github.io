In today's competitive environment, acquiring new skills is key to staying ahead. One such skill is the ability to use a version control system, and Git is one of the most popular tools available.

We are excited to announce that the CEOL community will organise a professional workshop on Git and GitHub. This workshop will take place on April 8th, 2023, from 2 pm to 4 pm and will be held at EB100 in the New SCIS building at the University of Hyderabad.

We strongly encourage everyone to attend this workshop to learn about the benefits of Git and GitHub and gain practical experience using these tools. This will help us work more efficiently and effectively while enhancing our professional development.
